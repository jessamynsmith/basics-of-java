        # Code Editor
        
        Editing text is the basis of programming. Having a good text editor and becoming proficient
        in its use will make programming far more efficient, effective, and enjoyable.
        
        There are many choices available, from using a plain text editor like vim to using
        an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like WebStorm. This week we will be using 
        [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/), an online IDE.

        #Node.js
        
        From the Node.js website:
        <div class="example">
        As an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, Node is designed to build scalable network applications.
        </div>
        Node.js allows the creation of web server environments using JavaScript, without the need 
        for a back-end language like Java. Node.js provides us with a package manager called npm, which
        allows installation of libraries (code created and packaged by other developers).

        <h1>HTML, CSS & JavaScript</h1>

        <p>JavaScript was created to manipulate web pages written in HTML and also works with CSS.</p>

        <p><strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is used to define the content and structure of web pages.</p>
        
        <div class="example">

        #Using Cloud9
        
        Let's create a workspace for our experimental work during the week
        
        1. In Cloud9, go to your Dashboard
        1. Click "Create a new workspace"
        1. Give it a name, e.g. "Education Unlimited CP"
        1. Set the repository to "Private"
        1. Choose the "Node.js" template
        1. Click "Create workspace"
        
        In time, you will find which editor and settings work best for you. For now, I recommend
        having the IDE warn before exiting, to minimize the chance of losing your work.
        
        Go to **Cloud9** -> **Preferences** -> **User Settings** and toggle on "Warn Before Exiting"

# What Is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language, i.e. a way for humans to give instructions to computers.

    function sayHello(message){
        alert(message);
    }
    var myVariable = "Hello World";
    sayHello(myVariable);
              
Like most other programming languages, JavaScript has **data types**, **variables**, **functions**, **objects** 
              and **control structures** such as **if** statements and **loops**.

# The Console
The console is an interactive tool, built into the browser. We can use this tool to enter commands and interact directly with a web page, log diagnostic information and check for errors. We'll be using it today to practice writing some JavaScript code. The console in Chrome looks like this:

![The Console](framework/img/workshop/the_console_x.jpg)

**Note the ```>``` symbol.** It is used by the console to represent a space for you to enter your input but you don't have to actually type it.
        </section>
        <section class="slide">
            <h1>Accessing the Console</h1>

            <p>In Chrome, there are a couple ways to open the Console tab.</p>

            <p>Use the keyboard shortcut: <br>
            <code>COMMAND + OPTION + J</code> (MAC) <br>
            <code>CONTROL + SHIFT + J</code> (WINDOWS/LINUX).</p>

            <p>OR</p>

            <p>Select: <code>View &gt; Developer &gt; JavaScript Console</code>.</p>

            <p>You can open the console when viewing <em>any</em> HTML page so let’s use this blank HTML page, <a href="framework/console.html">console.html</a> so we can have a blank slate to practice with throughout the day. </p>

            <p>Open <a href="framework/console.html">console.html</a> now and take a moment to practice opening and closing the console until you’re comfortable with it.</p>

            <div class="presenter-notes">
                <p>Re-iterate to the class to keep console.html open in a tab to refer back to for the console exercises.  A blank document was created rather than opening the console in the slide deck so any errors showing won't confuse the learners and take away from the lesson explaining things not needed for the task at hand.</p>

# Mini-exercise

Let's experiment with typing some input into the console. Return to **console.html** and open the console. After the `>` symbol, type your favorite number and press the enter/return key. 

You will see something like this:

![console number](framework/img/workshop/console-number.gif)

The ```>``` symbol is used by the console to represent a space for your input.    
The ```&lt;``` symbol is used by the console to represent the **returned value** of your input.  

You can also input text BUT when using text, make sure you put it in quotes (more on this soon).

![console string](framework/img/workshop/console-string.gif)

The command you input into the console gets *evaluated* and a value is returned back to you.

# What *is* a variable?

A variable is a named memory location which contains some known or unknown quantity or information.

**In *English*, please.**

Variables are like containers or a box. They are used to **store** values that can be used at any time, whenever you need them. At its most basic, we make a variable when we give a **name** to a **value**.  

When creating or *declaring* a variable, you must use the keyword `var` but you can name the variable anything you want. End the command with a semi-colon (`;`) so JavaScript knows you're done.

Let's look at the below example.

```javascript
   var myVariable = "Hello World";
/*  |       |            |
   keyword  |           value given to variable
            |
           variable name created by you          
*/
```

We are taking the value ```Hello World``` and giving it the name ```myVariable```. 

This is referred to as *assigning* a value to the *variable*. Evaluate everything to the right of the equals sign, then assign this value to the variable on the left side.

        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
#Naming a Variable

Variables can't contain spaces so a convention called camel case is generally used. Every new word is capitalized and the result looks kind of `likeCamelHumps`. 

JavaScript is case sensitive (uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently) so variable names are also case sensitive.

Use a descriptive name to make it easier to see, what kind of value that variable is going to hold.

`var firstName;` ← Clear that first name will go here.   
`var fn;`        ← Not as obvious as firstName.   
`var x; `        ← Not clear at all.
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
# Variable Types: Strings

When you store any amount of text, like words or sentences, the variable type is a **string** value and must be contained in quotes.

```javascript
var myVariable = "Hello World";
```

You can *add* strings together to make longer strings. This is called `concatenation`.

```javascript
var first = "Hello";
var second = "World";
var wholePhrase = first + " " + second;
```

The JavaScript above **concatenates** the three items together:

1. the variable `first` with the value `"Hello"`
* the **anonymous** string value `" "` to add a space.
* the variable `second` with the value `"World"`

So the results of the variable `wholePhrase` is:

var wholePhrase = first + " " + second;  
= "Hello" + " " + "World"  
= "Hello World"

            <h1>Class exercise</h1>

            <p>Create a variable called <code>favFood</code> and give it a value. What is the syntax for creating a variable and assigning a string value?</p>

            <pre class="delayed"><code>var favFood = "pizza";</code></pre>

            <p class="delayed">Try adding the above code into the console on <strong>console.html</strong>. What value gets returned? <code class="delayed">undefined</code></p>

            <div class="delayed">
                <p>That is perfectly fine. Remember, variables are used to <strong>store</strong> values until you're ready to use them.  <code>favFood</code> is still holding on to the value so it returns nothing (undefined). But now, JavaScript now knows that you've assigned a value to a variable.  To actually <strong>use</strong> the variable, just type <code>favFood</code> into the console. It will now <strong>return</strong> the value that it was storing.</p>

                <img src="framework/img/workshop/console-fav-food.gif" alt="">
            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="slide">
            <h1>Class exercise (continued)</h1>

            <p>Let’s try <strong>concatenating</strong> some strings with the <code>favFood</code> variable. In the console, try typing this command:</p>

            <pre><code>"My favorite food is " + favFood;</code></pre>

            <p><img src="framework/img/workshop/console-concatenate.gif" alt="concatenate example" title=""></p>

            <p>Note that when we execute a command without <code>var</code>, the assigned value of the variable gets returned instead of <code>undefined</code>. Reminder, <code>var</code> is used to a <em>declare</em> and create a variable and will hold the value, until used.</p>

            <p><strong>Challenge!</strong> How would you add a period to the end of the sentence?</p>

            <div class="presenter-notes">

# Variable Types: Strings and Quotes

JavaScript understands strings as values that are wrapped in either 'single quotes'  or "double quotes."  You can use either style but you must start and end the string with the same mark.

```javascript
var works = "This string value's the bomb!!!";
var fails = 'This string value's the bomb!!!'; 
```
```javascript
/*          ^                 ^
            |_________________| 
            |
            Javascript thinks the string ends with the second apostrophe.
            It is then expecting the command to end with a semicolon (;) 
            and will return an error.
*/
```
```
var alsoWorks = "Then I said: 'That string value was the bomb!!!' ";
var alsoFails = "Then I said: "That string value was the bomb!!!" ";                                   
```
Try copying each line and putting it into your console to check for errors.
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
# Variable Types: Strings and Quotes

To get around the issue shown in the previous slide, you can put a backslash (`\`) in front of the quote to *escape* the quote so it does not end the string.

```javascript
var totallyWorks = "Then I said, \"No way you can do that!!!\" ";
/*                 ^                                           ^
                   |                                           | 
                   |___________________________________________| 
                   |
                   JavaScript now sees a string starting and ending with the same symbol.
                   The variable 'totallyWorks' is assigned a string value of:
                        Then I said, "No way you can do that!!!"
*/
```
Another option is to use single quotes to enclose the entire string.

```javascript
var alsoWorks = 'Then I said, "Yes you can!!!" ';
```
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
# Variable Types: Numbers

Variable **values** can be one of several different **types**.  The most basic is a **number**.

    var meaningOfLife = 42; // Whole numbers are called 'integers'

JavaScript can also do math. Use `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `*` for multiplication and `/` for division.

```javascript
var endingValue = 5 * 2;
// This will return the value of 10.
```

The calculations work the same whether the values are numbers, or values stored in a variable:

```javascript
 var startingValue = 5;
 var multiplier = 2;
 var endingValue = startingValue * multiplier;
 // 'endingValue' is still 10.
 ```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            # Class Exercise

            Let's practice using numbers & arithmetic operators.   
            `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `*` for multiplication and `/` for division.

            ![doing math in the console](framework/img/workshop/console-math.gif)
            
            Now, try using these operators with variables.  Let's create a program for finding a person's age. Create two variables, one for `currentYear` and one for `birthYear` and subtract the values.

            ![doing math with variables in the console](framework/img/workshop/console-math-variables.gif)

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
# Exercise (5-10 mins)

Create a program using the concepts covered so far: variables & arithmetic operators.

How many seconds are there per day? 

* Create variables for `secondsPerMinute`, `minutesPerHour` and `hoursPerDay`.  
* Use those values to calculate `secondsPerDay`.

Feel free to use your own variable names or abbreviations. Just make sure to adhere to best practices for naming variables.

**Extra Challenge!**   
Use concatenation to output "There are x seconds per day."

(Advance to the next slide to see the solution.)

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
# Exercise Solution

![exercise 1 solution](framework/img/workshop/console-exercise-1.gif)
```javascript
var secondsPerMinute = 60;
var minutesPerHour = 60;
var hoursPerDay = 24;
var secondsPerDay = secondsPerMinute * minutesPerHour * hoursPerDay;

// This command will output the value of secondsPerDay
secondsPerDay;

// Concatenating strings with the secondsPerDay variable.
var sentence = "There are " + secondsPerDay + " seconds per day.";

// This command will output the value of sentence.
sentence;
```
        </section>
        
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
# Variable Types: Booleans

Variables that only contain a `true` or `false` value are called **booleans**

    var isJavaScriptCool = true;
    var isJavaScriptScary = false;
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
# Variable Types: Arrays

Variables can also hold a *list* of values (the values themselves being **types** like strings, numbers or booleans) in what is called an **array**. Note the syntax; the entire array value needs to be enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`, with each value separated by a comma *except* the last value.

```javascript
// Declaring the array and assigning values.
var myFavoriteThings = [ "Raindrops On Roses", "Whiskers On Kittens" ];
```

You can also write each value on its own line for readability.  JavaScript will ignore the line break.
```javascript
// Declaring the array and assigning values.
var myFavoriteThings = [ 
    "Raindrops On Roses", 
    "Whiskers On Kittens" 
];
``` 
        </section> 
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
#Array values

To access the value of a variable, use the variable name. For **arrays**, the values are accessed by their array name and **numerical index**, also contained in square brackets, which always **starts at ```0```**.  To get the value of the first item in an array, the syntax will look like this:

```javascript
myFavoriteThings[0];
```

![array vs variables](framework/img/workshop/console-var-array.gif)

Think of arrays as egg cartons. All the eggs are in one carton but each egg has its own slot.

An alternative way to declare and assign values to an array is to use the square bracket notation with the index number. This will give the same results as the example above.
```javascript
// Declaring an empty array.
var myFavoriteThings = [];
// Assigning values to the array.
myFavoriteThings[0] = "Raindrops On Roses";
myFavoriteThings[1] = "Whiskers On Kittens";
```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
# Variable Types: Objects

Another type of variable that can hold multiple values and types is an **object**. To *declare* an object, use the curly brackets `{}`. The values are written in property name and value pairs like this:

```javascript
var myObject = {
    propertyName: propertyValue,
    anotherPropertyName: anotherPropertyValue
}
```

You can even use an array as a property value.

```javascript
var vonTrappFamily = {
    father : "Captain Georg von Trapp",
    stepmother : "Maria von Trapp",
    children : [
        "Liesl von Trapp",
        "Friedrich von Trapp",
        "Louisa von Trapp",
        "Brigitta von Trapp",
        "Marta von Trapp",
        "Gretl von Trapp"
    ]
};
```
In the example above the object has 3 **properties**: ```father, stepmother & children```.
Notice how we use the curly braces ```{ }``` to denote an object and the square braces ```[ ]``` for an array.

# Variable Types: Objects (continued)

```javascript
var vonTrappFamily = {
    father : "Captain Georg von Trapp", //The value of the property 'father' is a string of text.
    stepmother : "Maria von Trapp", //The value of the property 'stepmother' is a string of text.
    children : [ //The value of the property 'children' is an array of items.
        "Liesl von Trapp", //Each array item is a string of text.
        "Friedrich von Trapp",
        "Louisa von Trapp",
        "Brigitta von Trapp",
        "Marta von Trapp",
        "Gretl von Trapp"
    ]
};
```
The pattern of an object is like this:

```javascript
var variableName = { propertyName : propertyValue, anotherPropertyName : another Value };
/*                 |     |        |      |       |         |                 |         |
                   |     |        |      |       |         |_________________|   curly brace 
                   |     |        |      |       |                           |   closes object
                   |     |        |      |       |          This can repeat for
                   |     |        |      |       |          as many properties as you like.
                   |     |        |      |       └ A comma (,) separates properties
                   |     |        |      └ The property value follows the colon.
                   |     |        └ A colon (:) is used to separate name from value
                   |     └  The property name must start with a letter and contain no spaces
                   └ The curly brace starts the object.

# Variable Types: Accessing an Object

Object values are accessed or set via a syntax called **dot notation**.  To access the value for the `father` property, it would look like this:

```javascript
vonTrappFamily.father = "Captain Georg von Trapp";
```
To get the value of one of the children, by accessing an array value *inside* of the object property, it would look like this:
```javascript
var notAllowedChampagne = vonTrappFamily.children[0];
```
This would set the value of the variable ```notAllowedChampagne``` to the string value of the first child in the array, ```Liesl von Trapp```. (Remember, array indexes always start at 0!)

**The variables that live inside objects are called ```properties```.** They are still variables, but when they are contained within an object, they are then referred to as **properties**.

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
#Class exercise: Objects

Using the object below, let's add this entire code block into our console and practice accessing various property values.

```javascript
var vonTrappFamily = {
    father : "Captain Georg von Trapp",
    stepmother : "Maria von Trapp",
    children : [
        "Liesl von Trapp",
        "Friedrich von Trapp",
        "Louisa von Trapp",
        "Brigitta von Trapp",
        "Marta von Trapp",
        "Gretl von Trapp"
    ]
};
```

# Variable Types

As you've just seen, there are *many* different variable types in JavaScript and many rules about how to write them.

It will take practice getting used to all different rules but it is important to understand that variables are used to hold values and the values themselves have different types.
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
# Ok, now what?

We have been practicing writing lines of JavaScript.  These lines of JavaScript can now be used to write software which are just a series of commands for a computer to follow. Now... we write code.

### What code?

That depends. What do you want your **program** to do? Let's look at [this menu example](framework/example-menu.html). Using JavaScript, we write out step by step instructions on how to do the following things:

* Pay attention to the links in the main menu of a page.
* Whenever someone hovers over one of those menu items, move a line to highlight the hovered item.
* When the mouse leaves, move the line back to where it was.

This example illustrates a short series of commands. When these series of commands are repetitive, rather than writing the same line(s) of code many times throughout our program, we can create a `function`.

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
# Functions

If a `variable` is a name for a value, then a `function` is a name for a **set** of commands or instructions. When we invoke a variable, it just returns the value.  When we invoke a function, it executes all the commands contained within, making it easier to make the code "do things."  

Let's look at two functions, `alert()` and `prompt()`.  These come built into JavaScript, for free!

Go back to the console and type both functions in, one at a time, and see what happens. Note the syntax for functions, the parentheses `()`, must be included.

        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
#Functions and Arguments

We've seen now that the `alert()` and `prompt()` functions create a pop-up in the browser but the pop-ups are blank.  We can also *pass* an **argument** *into* these functions by adding a value within the parentheses `()`.  Try this in the console:

```javascript
alert("Hello!");
```
```javascript
prompt("What day is it today?");
```

Whatever value you put within the parentheses will get passed into the function.

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
# Make your own functions!

You can create your own functions that can contain any number of instructions that you need, including other functions. Use the `function` keyword to declare a new function.

Let's look at this example: 

```javascript
function sayAnything(){
    alert("Hello World");
}
```
The above example creates a new **function** called `sayHello` but similar to variables, nothing will happen until the function is **called**.  

We've already had practice calling a function.  Remember `alert();` and `prompt();`?  Simply **call** the function by using the function name plus parentheses `()`. Let's add the above function declaration into the console and then execute it by calling it.

![console function example](framework/img/workshop/console-function.gif)

        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
#Functions, Arguments & Parameters

Functions can be used to make your life a LOT easier once you get used to how to write them.  A function should be used when you have something you need to do time and again in your project.

Just like with the built-in functions, you can also pass *arguments* into your own functions too.

Let's take another look at the function from the previous example.

```javascript
function sayAnything(){
    alert("Hello World");
}
```
Notice that the ```sayAnything()``` function has empty parentheses `()` while the ```alert()``` function has the **string** value "Hello World" in the parentheses `()`.

We can create a **parameter** to pass an argument into the function.

        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
# Creating Functions with Parameters
**Parameters** are data that are passed into a function as variables.

Instead of saying "Hello World" every time you call a function, you might want to say something different each time it is called.  Let's see what that might look like:

```javascript
// Declaring the function with a parameter of 'message'
function sayAnything(message){
    alert(message);
}

// Calling the function
sayAnything("Welcome to the EU summer camp!");
```
Now, when we call the function, we can pass an argument in the parentheses (`"Welcome to the EU summer camp!"`). That argument now becomes the value of `message` which will now populate the `message` in `alert(message)`.

Let's try it out in the console. First add the function, then call it. You can call the function as many times as you want with different arguments.

        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
#Multiple Parameters
                    
JavaScript allows for multiple parameters. When you call the function, add the values in the same order as the parameters declared in the function.

```javascript
function myCustomFunction(parameter1, parameter2, parameterN) {
/*             |              |           |          |
               |              |           |          └ You can have as many parameters as you need.
               |              |           └ The second parameter of the function.            
               |              └ The first parameter of the function.          
               └ The name of your function.                          
*/  
}

// Call the function with arguments in the same order
myCustomFunction(parameter1, parameter2, parameterN);

```
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
#Objects, Functions and Methods

What's the difference between these two?  The second one kind of looks like a function right?
``` javascript
alert();
console.log();
```

`alert()` is a **function**, it works on its own.

`log()` is a **method** because it's attached to an **object**, `console`. It will log a message (the argument passed into `log()`) and will only show in the console tool. 

This is much easier for testing and debugging than using `alert()`. No more pesky pop-ups!
        </section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
#Objects & Methods

Pretty much everything in JavaScript is an object.  Here's another example:

```javascript
// array object
var fruits = ["apples", "oranges", "pears"];

// accessing the 'length' property of the array object to find out how many there are.
var typesOfFruits = fruits.length;

// Output into the console the number of items and concatenated into a sentence. 
console.log("There are " + typesOfFruits + " types of fruit."); 
```

Try it out in the console.
